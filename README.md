# Euchre

Euchre The classic card game of Euchre built in Python. Euchre is a fast-paced, trick taking card game usually played with 2 teams of 2 players on each team. It is played with half a deck of 24 cards (9, 10, J, Q, K, A) from a standard deck of playing cards, and all four suits (Spades, Diamonds, Clubs, Hearts). The team with the most tricks at the end of each round gets points, and the first team to 10 points wins!

This program will replicate a standard game of Euchre in which is played on the commandline. For now, the user will play the hand of each player in the game, entering numbered prompts from the commandline. They have mostly full visibility to each player, and since there is no multiplayer functionality at the moment, they have full visibility to each players hand.

This was created for my love of the game, and a fun project to build to practice my skills in Python.
